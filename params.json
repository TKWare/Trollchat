{"name":"Trollchat","body":"TrollChat, or as it's known in world, the \"Troll Chat Transmogrifier\" is a script which modifies incoming chat text to look like that made by one of the 12 troll characters from Homestuck. Think Leetspeak, alternating caps, weird punctuation, that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nYou can copy this script into your own object in world and use as is - all I ask is that you don't flog this as your own work, and that you credit me if you use the code anywhere else.\r\n\r\nIf you really like what you see, I sell this in world for L$299 with appropriate graphics in a neat little package. You can find that here: https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/Troll-Chat-Transmogrifier/2237703\r\n\r\n\r\n### Using the script\r\n\r\nCopy both of the provided scripts into a small object in world, and then attach it to your HUD. Once this is done, you can click the object, and you will receive a menu. Simply click on the name of the troll who's chatting style you wish to emulate.\r\n\r\nNote that you will get all kinds of script errors regarding trying to set images, since the version I sell inworld has appopriate astrological symbols so you can see who you are chatting as. You would have to load placeholder images, or simply remove that portion of the script.\r\n\r\n### A demonstration of each troll\r\n\r\n```\r\nKarkat Vantas\r\nWHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT, FUCKASS?\r\n\r\nTerezi Pyrope\r\nH3Y RIN, IS THIS YOU? >:]\r\n\r\nFeferi Pyxies\r\nCod, I am SOOOOO ---EXCIT--ED!\r\n\r\nGamzee Makara\r\nMiRaClEs, MaAaAan.
