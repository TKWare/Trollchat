          <p>TrollChat, or as it's known in world, the "Troll Chat Transmogrifier" is a script which modifies incoming chat text to look like that made by one of the 12 troll characters from Homestuck. Think Leetspeak, alternating caps, weird punctuation, that sort of thing.</p>

<p>You can copy this script into your own object in world and use as is - all I ask is that you don't flog this as your own work, and that you credit me if you use the code anywhere else.</p>

<p>If you really like what you see, I sell this in world for L$299 with appropriate graphics in a neat little package. You can find that here: <a href="https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/Troll-Chat-Transmogrifier/2237703">https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/Troll-Chat-Transmogrifier/2237703</a></p>

<h3>Using the script</h3>

<p>Copy both of the provided scripts into a small object in world, and then attach it to your HUD. Once this is done, you can click the object, and you will receive a menu. Simply click on the name of the troll who's chatting style you wish to emulate.</p>

<p>Note that you will get all kinds of script errors regarding trying to set images, since the version I sell inworld has appopriate astrological symbols so you can see who you are chatting as. You would have to load placeholder images, or simply remove that portion of the script.</p>

<h3>A demonstration of each troll</h3>
